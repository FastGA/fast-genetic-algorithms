**fastga** is an extremely small module sporting our so-called *fast mutation operator* (or *heavy-tailed mutation operator*), which is designed to perform bitwise mutation using a power-law-distributed mutation rate. This allows a high number of bits to be flipped in one step with high probability (compared to the classical (1+1) EA for example), which is especially desirable when such long-distance "jumps" are necessary to escape local optima.

Requirements
============

- python3+
- NumPy

Installation
============

The pip way (recommended)
-------------------------

**(Optionnal)** Create a python virtual environment and activate it. In a console, type :

::

    $ virtualenv ~/some_convenient_location/fastga
    $ cd ~/some_convenient_location/fastga
    $ source bin/activate

In a console (with your virtualenv activated if you use one), type :

::

    $ pip install fastga

The git way
-----------

Simply clone this repository to a convenient location :

::

    $ mkdir some_convenient_location && cd some_convenient_location
    $ git clone https://github.com/FastGA/fast-genetic-algorithms.git

then add it to your **PYTHONPATH** :

::

    $ export PYTHONPATH=some_convenient_location:$PYTHONPATH

(you can also put this command in your .bashrc file to make it permanent).

Usage
=====

Our mutation operator is implemented in the class ``FastMutationOperator``, along with the abstract class ``BaseMutationOperator`` (which you shouldn't use directly but rather subclass to your own classes if needed) and the class ``OnePlusOneMutationOperator`` (which, as the name suggests, is an implementation of the (1+1) EA). In a python shell, type

::

    from fastga import FastMutationOperator

Two parameters are required to create an instance :

- an integer ``n`` which is the size of the bit strings that can be mutated by the operator ;
- a float ``beta`` > 1 which is the exponent used in the mutation rate power law.

Given these two parameters, the operator's mutation rate *r* is such that, for each *i* in {1 .. n//2}, the probability that *r* is *i/n* is proportional to i^{-beta} (with a suitable normalization factor). As such, lower values of beta tend to favor a higher number of bits flipped in one mutation step.

You can now instantiate an operator :

::

    operator = FastMutationOperator(n=100, beta=1.5)

and use its ``mutate`` method to mutate *n*-length bit strings :

::

    bit_string = [0] * 100
    for i in range(10):
        operator.mutate(bit_string, inplace=True)
        print(bit_string)
