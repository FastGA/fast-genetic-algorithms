**fastga** is an extremely small module sporting our so-called *fast mutation operator* (or *heavy-tailed mutation operator*), which is designed to perform bitwise mutation using a power-law-distributed mutation rate. This allows a high number of bits to be flipped in one step with high probability (compared to the classical (1+1) EA for example), which is especially desirable when such long-distance "jumps" are necessary to escape local optima...

Requirements
============

- python3+
- NumPy

Installation
============

In a console, type

    pip install fastga

Usage
=====

Our mutation operator is implemented in the class **FastMutationOperator**. In a python shell, type

    from fastga import FastMutationOperator

Two parameters are required to create an instance :

- an integer **n** which is the size of the bit strings that can be mutated by the operator ;
- a float **beta** > 1 which is the exponent used in the mutation rate power law.

Given these two parameters, the operator's mutation rate *r* is such that, for each *i* in {1 .. n//2}, the probability that *r* is *i/n* is proportional to i^{-beta} (with a suitable normalization factor). As such, lower values of beta tend to favor a higher number of bits flipped in one mutation step.

You can now instantiate an operator :

    operator = FastMutationOperator(n=100, beta=1.5)

and use its **mutate** method to mutate *n*-length bit strings :

    bit_string = [0] * 100
    for i in range(10):
        operator.mutate(bit_string, inplace=True)
        print(bit_string)
